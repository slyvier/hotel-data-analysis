# hotel-data-analysis
Hello, this time i'll do some data analysis to a hotel dataset
few question I will answer in this sheet is :

1. Where do the guests come from?
2. How much do guests pay for a room per night?
3. How does the price per night vary over the year?
4. Which are the busiest months?
5. How long do people stay at the hotels?
6. Bookings by market segment
7. How many bookings were cancelled?
8. Which month has the highest number of cancellations?

I include the dataset in this project, feel free to manipulate the data yourself !
hope you entertained and learn something. Thank You.
